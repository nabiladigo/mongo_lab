(For the mongo deliverable please add to the README.md by describing what shell commands worked, what problems you ran into and what additional methods you tried out if you were able to have time for that)

# all the shell commands worked pretty nice. 
# I didn't understand "db.hits.update().
# I tryed couple shell commands:
    db.collection.find().sort(<sort order>)
    db.collection.find( ... ).limit( <n> )
    db.collection.count()
